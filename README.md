# Rank-King
I'm often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options available to me in food, products, and media today. While applications exist that show other user's reviews, they may not have my taste, or grade on the criteria of what I think makes a product stand out.\
--\
My solo mobile application allows users to create categories, and add items and grading criteria within those categories to show the best of the best.\
--\
For example, I could create an Ice Cream category, and choose to grade on creaminess, flavor, and price point. Now whenever I'm at the store, or trying something new, I can know how it personally compares to other products on the market.
Designed for quick use or reference, Rank King allows users to easily and clearly find previous submissions or submit something new to always stay up to date.\
--\
Rank King does this by averaging the various criteria stores of items within a certain category and displaying them from high to low.\
--\
Future development ideas include giving the users options to weigh criteria scores heavier or lighter, and subcategories.
Developed in React Native using MongoDB Stitch.
